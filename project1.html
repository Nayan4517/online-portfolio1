        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project uses deep learning to colorize black-and-white images.</p>
        
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>The black-and-white image colorization project employs advanced artificial intelligence techniques to transform grayscale images into vibrant and realistic colorized versions. This innovative application leverages deep learning algorithms, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained on extensive datasets to predict and apply suitable colors to black-and-white images.</p>
        
        <p>The project integrates Python as the backend programming language, using OpenCV for image preprocessing and manipulation. A pre-trained deep learning model forms the core of the colorization process, ensuring high accuracy and realistic results. Flask, a lightweight web framework, powers the user interface, enabling seamless interaction between users and the AI system. The frontend, designed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, provides a user-friendly experience, allowing users to upload grayscale images and instantly view the colorized results.</p>
        
        <p>This tool addresses a significant gap in image restoration and enhancement, catering to various applications, including photo restoration, historical archives, and media enhancement. Its simple architecture ensures accessibility for users, requiring minimal setup and enabling them to harness AI's potential for colorization effortlessly. The project showcases the effective integration of AI and web technologies, emphasizing both functionality and user experience.</p>

        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <p>Python, OpenCV, Deep Learning (TensorFlow/Keras)</p>
